# Statistical-Consulting-for-Rhode-Island-Public-Health-Initiative
## This is the repository for my experience in project management for the Rhode Island Public Health Institute in Fall 2023.

In this project, I worked in a team of four to consult for the Rhode Island Public Health Institute. Our primary goal was to determine the food security of the member base that shops at the Institute's various locations using state welfare like SNAP or EBT to purchase groceries. These members are a part of what is referred to by the Institute as the 'Food On The Move' (FOTM) Program. The target consumer is of low socioeconomic standing and is therefore more likely to be associated with not having adequate food security, as measured by the USDA.

Our primary goal for this project was to combine the quantitative data of spending from members of the program between 2020-2023 with qualitative self-assessment data to identify the food security of a given member. 

This would in turn lead to regression and other statistical analysis to determine food security aggregates across various ranges of expenditure at the program, whilst controlling for key demographic variables like age, household size, and physical activity.

## Disclaimer:
Whilst the findings of this project cannot be disclosed due to the signing of an NDA, this 3-month long venture into the non-profit world aims to optimize the function of this business of eradicating food insecurity in the state of Rhode Island, and I'm glad data was able to be of use.

## In this repository, you'll find:
- *4x .do files (Stata format)*: in this repository are examples of data management processes used in this project.

- *Team4_FinalReport2023(redactedinfo).pdf*: The final written report as a PDF (confidential data marked out)

- *RIPHI Team4 Final Presentation.pptx*: The final presentation shown to stakeholders at the end of the project term- included as a Microsoft PowerPoint.

Note: Unfortunately, the original datasets cannot be included due to the NDA signed.
